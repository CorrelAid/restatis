**{restatis}** is a wrapper around the RESTful APIs that provide access to the three main databases of German official statistics:

- The [**GENESIS database** of the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis)](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online),
- [**regionalstatistik.de** which is the database of the German Länder (Regionaldatenbank)](https://www.regionalstatistik.de/genesis/online/),
- The [database of the **German 2022 Census** (Zensus 2022)](https://ergebnisse.zensus2022.de/datenbank/online/).

Almost all functions work on either one of them, on all of them or just on a selection.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `{restatis}` from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("restatis")
```

Or install a development version of `{restatis}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/CorrelAid/restatis) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CorrelAid/restatis")
```

## Usage

### Authentication

To access each one of the APIs, you need to have an account that you can create on the homepage (see links to them above) and store your username and password for use in R with `restatis::gen_auth_save()` (see `?gen_auth_save` for more details). 

**Note:** The GENESIS and Zensus 2022 databases do support authentication with an API token as well. You can set the token as credential by using setting the parameter `use_token = TRUE` for `restatis::gen_auth_save()`. The token itself can be found when logging into the respective webpage with your account and by clicking on *Webservice (API)* (EN) or *Webservice-Schnittstelle (API)* (DE) in the bottom left corner. **Important:** Both GENESIS and Zensus 2022 databases will not let you create jobs when using API tokens to authenticate. This is why `{restatis}` will check your credential type once you set `job = TRUE` for `gen_table()` or `gen_cube()` and error in case a token is used. To enable the use of jobs, use `gen_auth_save()` and input your username and password (by setting `use_token = FALSE`).

### Main features

{restatis} provides functions (prefixed with `gen_`) for finding, exploring, and retrieving data from the three supported APIs. See the ["Basic restatis workflow" vignette](https://correlaid.github.io/restatis/articles/restatis.html) for an overview of the main features of the package.

In short, there are functions divided in two main parts, searching for (meta)data and retrieving data:

#### Searching for (meta)data
- **gen_catalogue()**: Search the API's catalogue of data
- **gen_find()**: Find objects related to a search term
- **gen_metadata()**: Find meta data to an objects
- **gen_alternative_terms()**: Find alternative terms to a search term
- **gen_modified_data()**: Find out when an object has last been modified
- **gen_objects2stat()**, **gen_objects2var()**, **gen_var2stat()**, **gen_val2var()**, **gen_val2var2stat()** and **gen_search_vars()**: Find objects, statistics, variables and values related to each other

#### Retrieving data
- **gen_cube()**: Using this function, you can download 'cube' objects
- **gen_table()**: Using this function, you can download 'table' objects 
- **gen_list_jobs()** and **gen_download_job()**: Using this function, you can find and download previously created jobs (large tables)

#### Other functions
- **gen_logincheck()**: Perform a logincheck to test your credentials
- **gen_signs()**: Get a list of quality signs (special characters) found in the API's tables
- **gen_update_evas()**: Manually scrape a newer version of the EVAS numbers (official statistic IDs)

### Caching

`{restatis}` uses [**memoisation**](https://github.com/r-lib/memoise) to cache query results. This means that if you call a function multiple times with the same input, the values returned the first time are stored and reused from the second time. Cached objects are stored in the memory and do not persist across R sessions. With version 0.3.0, we have enabled users to turn off caching, this is especially useful for working with jobs (so that the list of jobs from `gen_list_jobs()` won't get cached). The caching option is set to TRUE by default and can be changed by setting `options(restatis.use_cache = TRUE)` (or `FALSE`, respectively). You can get the current state of the option by using `getOption("restatis.use_cache")`.
